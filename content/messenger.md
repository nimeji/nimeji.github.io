# PPRL Messenger Demonstration
This application was developed as part of the [ScaDS.AI](https://scads.ai/) Living Lab, an initiative to make current research topics more accessible to Students. 

On the hypothetical website *chooseyourmessenger*, users search for their personal information in the address books of other users using different instant messaging apps. This allows users to choose a messenger based on the number of contacts that use it. All personal information and address books are hashed in a way that allows evaluating similarity while protecting privacy.

This demonstration shows a possible use case of Privacy Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL). It shows the above concept in a simplified form and includes explanations of the various PPRL steps.

The App Demo has the explanation videos removed.
