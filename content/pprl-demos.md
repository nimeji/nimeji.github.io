# PPRL Demos
This App was my first React project and was developed during my time as a student assistant at the University of Leipzig. It currently only includes 2 Demonstrations.

##### PPIRL
Privacy Perserving Interactive Record Linkage (PPIRL) is a record linkage procedure in which humans compare masked personally identifiable information to complete the record linkage task. 

In this demo users can play around with different masking methods and try to correctly identify the given record linkage pair.

##### Bloomfilters
Bloomfilters are a popular way to encode personally identifiable information in Privacy Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) tasks.

In this demo users can enter fake personal information, view the resulting bloomfilters and compare the attributes and bloomfilters of those records.

The Bloomfilter demo uses mock APIs.

##### Technologies used
Javascript, React, MaterialUI
